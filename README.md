# School Project 1: Javascript Pokemon Power Battle

This is is a simple game in which you can draft a pokemon team from pool of 3 until you have a total of 6 team. If your combined attack total is more than your opponents, then you win. If not, try again.
For a touch of random fun, randomize your opponent and see how well you do in a new draft.
